GDPR
Below is listed all information we store and for what purpose(s). All information is saved on
 our servers. This is done so we can track orders, know where to send them and to contact our 
 customers. All information is saved for a year. All cusotmers are able to change any piece 
 of information about themselves at any time by simply emailing us. Users can and may change 
 any address information, though products that have been sent to a different address will 
 still be delivered to the old address. Users can also ask us to delete all information at 
 any time. We will delete evrything. However, we will not be able to contact that user so if 
 there are any open orders, they may not be delivered since we have no address information 
 enymore at that time and any contact notifying the user that their product(s) cannot be 
 delivered cannot be sent to them since we have no contact information anymore. We do not 
 sell any customer information to third-party services.
